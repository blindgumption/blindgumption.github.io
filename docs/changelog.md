# BlindGumption Change Log

## Step 1: 2023-09-06

Finally figured out the github action problem I was having with the mkdocs gh-pages branch.
BlindGumption documentation can now be found at
[the github pages for the blindgumption/blindgumption repo](https://blindgumption.github.io/blindgumption/).

## Step 0: 2023-09-05

Created the new blindgumption repo and started its documentation in various markdown files.
