# BlindGumption Documentation 

Welcome to the documentation for the 
[blindgumption repo](https://github.com/blindgumption/blindgumption/).
For the actual website, visit 
[blindgumption.com](https://blindgumption.com).

I wanted somewhere other than the README file in the github repo to document what I'm doing with BlindGumption.
So I decided to use mkdocs and github pages for the blindgumption/blindgumption repo documentation.

At some point, blindgumption.com will/might have a blog of its own.  Some documentation will be moved there.  Specifically, I plan to write about what I'm working on, challenges I'm facing, and how I resolve them.
Until then, most of my writing/thinking will be done in 
[the captain's log](captainslog.md).
